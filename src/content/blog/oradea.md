# Road Trip Through Transylvania

When most people hear "Transylvania," they think of vampires. While Dracula's legend is part of the region's appeal, the real magic lies in its stunning landscapes, medieval towns, and warm-hearted people.

## The Route

Our journey took us through some of Romania's most beautiful regions:

- Brașov → Bran → Sighișoara → Sibiu → Cluj-Napoca

## Medieval Towns

### Brașov

Nestled at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains, Brașov is the perfect starting point. The Council Square (Piața Sfatului) is surrounded by colorful baroque buildings and mountain views.

**Don't miss:**
- Hiking to the Hollywood-style Brașov sign
- Exploring the narrow streets of the old town
- Visiting the Black Church, the largest Gothic church in Romania

### Sighișoara

A UNESCO World Heritage site and the birthplace of Vlad the Impaler. This citadel is like stepping into a fairy tale with its:

- Colorful houses
- Cobblestone streets
- The iconic Clock Tower
- Medieval festivals in summer

### Sibiu

Named European Capital of Culture in 2007, Sibiu charmed us with its:

- "Eyes of Sibiu" - unique roof windows on old houses
- Three connected squares in the old town
- Vibrant arts scene
- Cozy cafes and restaurants

## The Castles

### Bran Castle

Yes, this is "Dracula's Castle." While the connection to Vlad the Impaler is tenuous, the castle itself is impressive. The real treasure is the surrounding village and mountain scenery.

### Peleș Castle

Perhaps Romania's most beautiful castle, Peleș is a Neo-Renaissance masterpiece nestled in the mountains. The interior is just as stunning as the exterior, with intricate wood carvings and stained glass windows.

## Nature and Hiking

Transylvania isn't just about towns and castles. The Carpathian Mountains offer incredible hiking opportunities:

- **Transfăgărășan**: One of the world's most spectacular mountain roads
- **Bucegi Mountains**: Dramatic rock formations and panoramic views
- **Apuseni Mountains**: Caves, gorges, and traditional villages

## Local Culture

The region is home to Saxon villages with fortified churches, Roma communities with vibrant traditions, and Hungarian influences in architecture and cuisine.

### Food Highlights

- **Kürtőskalács** (Chimney cake): A sweet rolled pastry
- **Ciorbă de burtă**: Tripe soup (don't knock it till you try it!)
- **Varză à la Cluj**: Layered cabbage with meat
- Local palinka (fruit brandy) - approach with caution!

## Practical Tips

1. **Rent a car**: Public transport exists but having your own wheels gives you freedom
2. **Stay in guesthouses**: Experience traditional Romanian hospitality
3. **Learn basic Romanian**: Especially in smaller villages where English is less common
4. **Take your time**: This region deserves more than a rushed tour

## Final Thoughts

Transylvania exceeded all our expectations. It's a region where time moves slower, where traditions are preserved, and where nature reminds you of its power and beauty.

Whether you're a history buff, nature lover, or food enthusiast, Transylvania has something special to offer. It's become one of our favorite places in the world, and we can't wait to explore more of its hidden corners.
