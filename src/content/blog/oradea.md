# Oradea

Oradea above all is my (Cata) hometown. What I present here is through my lens with an emphasis on things that I would like to show you. I have not tried all the below place - but everything below is a combination of things that I know and I like, things that people told me - and things where I am like "damn, this was not here, it could be cool to see". I am trying to provide you with both traditional as well as modern things.


I put together a map that comprises a lot of the things from below. The city is pretty walkable for the most part - so it should take you realistically about 1 - 2 days to see everything. Of course, Lam and I are fast travelers - we walk and do a lot when we travel.

## Things to see & do

### Palatul Episcopiei Romano Catolice

While not a must, this is a pretty good starting point that could take you through the rest of the city.
This used to be a Museum, then the Catholic Church claimed it back. This complex also has the [Roman Catholic Cathedral](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xjz1KRD4YJUo68Uq9) - which is the largest Baroque church in Romania, and **Sirul Canonicilor** - a long corridor of Baroque style arches.
From here, walk down the **Petőfi Sándor  Park** towards the City Center.

### City Center - "Calea Republicii" (Republicii Walking Street)

If you are to pick one thing to get a feel for the city - start here. You will see many historical buildings in a combination of Baroque, Art Nouveau and Art Deco architecture - which we take a lot of pride in.

Start from the big Mcdonalds (yes), walk down and see the [Moskovitz Palace](https://www.oradeaheritage.ro/the-moskovits-miksa-palace/?lang=en) (though more like a house then a Palace), end up by the [Queen Maria Theater - *Teatrul Regina Maria*](https://www.teatrulreginamaria.ro/).

Along this street you will see a lot of restaurants and bars. If you are feeling peckish and would love a snack, stop by [ La Turcu ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qpy472RCTjxmmyKn7) for a shaorma or Doner Kebab. This is not a joke - Romanians do love their shaorma - it is the main fast food over burgers and fries.

If you are in a fancy Italian restaurant mood - stop at [Allegria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SeL8ubTqFhoh3rfh9) or [ReWine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tVe3E6N5T4Gxc7yj7) for some wine.

Also, behind the theater, there is this hip yet no frills cafe/bar - [Moskva](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dpT8SaH9Fr4H7bko7). No frills, just the basic drinks, go for the cool space which resembles the vibe of a Budapest-style ruin bar.

If you are feeling more like soup in a bread bowl, then try stopping by at [Cyrano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sZvYQ7pX9r5CW2Uq9). then turn right and go to the [Casa Darvas - La Roche](https://www.visitoradea.com/what-to-see/darvas-la-roche-house) and visit it if you have the time.


### Piata Unirii - "Union Square"

From the *Republicii Street* , by the end, you could cross the bride towards the "Union Square" of Oradea. There, you will see the [City Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8MkDhi9Hn7CmxCX18) - consider climbing on top!

From there, you will find yourself in a plaza. See the [Black Eagle Palace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3xFtNnkT9v5jxrh69) and [Biserica cu Luna](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oVsQh6ZQG2X1Cs986) - *Moon Church* (this is the unofficial name given due to its top mechanism reflecting the moon phase) on the left, and [Biserica Sf Nicolae](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DLYpZm4Yj3dbZuyh9) - *Saint Nicholas Church* on the right (this is where our wedding will be!)

### "Pasajul" and "Alecsandri"

While in "Union Square" - you will see a passage through the [Black Eagle Palace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3xFtNnkT9v5jxrh69) ("Pasajul") and another street "Alecsandri". For people in Oradea, especially young people - this area is the Oradea equivalent of the NY East Village or London "Shoredich". Not to over-hype it - but to get how a high school/college student perceived this area.

To get an idea of what I considered "cool" as a teen and where I would still catch up with people, check out [Lord's Pub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/daq3sKs6LkATQFTC8) (especially if you are a Rock music listener), [Green Pub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bo1VMXDAU5F7Tr44A) or [Columbus Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fXGWBvYwP9VSDabC6). However, if you feel like teleporting to a New York-style speakeasy bar with award winning cocktails - check out [Prohibition Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K5F6u8YdT4LoZohM6).

### Medieval Citadel

One of the more unique things about the city is the Citadel.
As good for a walk in the park as well as getting in a bit of culture and history or the experience of dining in a medieval building. You can visit it as quickly as 15 minutes, or take your time to enjoy the outdoors, some of the museums and art galleries inside. The Citadel is hosting the Museum of the City of Oradea, as well as a micro-museum dedicated to bread making! (literally takes 5 minutes to see).

Check out <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/VdAaGoebsGJJph1W8"> Piata 9
</a> for a great (non-traditional) brunch - their bread is great!

For a more formal restaurant and wine try out <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/svGbBHBKpW4WMqvJ7">Meridian 0 </a>

### Dealul Ciuperca - "Mushroom Hill"

If you feel like you ate too much and need some exercise - or are just a fan of panoramic views - consider walking up the [Dealul Ciuperca](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NhawDTgDDDkxssTr6). From the top you should see a nice view of the city, so consider going for sunset.
At the top there is also [Restaurant Ciuperca](https://maps.app.goo.gl/U9vBcFc8d7Pj2Yx3A). I cannot talk about the food quality, but **papanași** and **mititei** should be good, especially if you prioritize a view.


### Spas

In our area we are known for our thermal baths. If you feel like relaxing a bit - try [Nymphea Spa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CcspYeGjWeGoNg6N9). If you don't mind going a bit out of your way, take a quick trip to [Baile Felix](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4aHH7f8jUJPQVD2Z8) and check out [Apollo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ki7MAUrQaBYJpxwt9) or [Aquapark President](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gNwPyw1mqbGwGE5R6)

## Things to eat and where to eat them

Now, I have to say that a lot of the food that I know and like is home made food that it might be hard to find in a restaurant. I will also say that we are not that purist when it comes to food, there is not a "super specific" way of making this - it's more like whatever you remember your mom taught you how to do it. Then maybe make it better and serve it in a restaurant. Nuances exist, while at times I will provide specific dishes, other times I might just provide a style.

### Plăcintă

This is a stuffed pie, typically filled with cheese, potatoes or pickled cabbage. Get it from anywhere that advertises "Plăcintă" (the dish) or "Plăcintărie". Different parts of the country make it in different ways. In Bihor, we are cooking it in a pan on the stovetop, with a bit of oil.
For a more unique experience get the one filled with pickled cabbage. Ask for sour cream on top if you like things more saucy/creamy.

### Langos

Oradea has a big Hungarian population which makes Langos a very common snack or quick meal. You will find it at the same spots that sell Plăcintă as it is its rebel cousin. By that I mean this is a piece of fried plain dough, usually covered with sour cream and cheese - add some garlic mujdei (garlic pressed with salt, mixed with sour cream) if you are feeling adventurous.

### **Kürtőskalács** (Chimney cake)

This is the controversial one. This dish is Transylvanian which makes both Romanians and Hungarians entitled to claim. The name is Hungarian though, from a geographic perspective it originates on our territory. We are not going over the history of Transylvania here...

Now - this is mostly available during celebrations/seasonal markets. There are not really places that are dedicated to making it. If you stumble upon it - you need to get the large one covered with walnut and sugar - that is the most standard one. If walnut is an issue - try cinnamon. Everything else is not "the real deal" (yes, forget the handheld decadent ones filled with whipping cream and chocolate that you find in the Americas - not a thing).

### Sour Cream Soups - "Ciorbă"

In Romania we love our sour cream. One of the common ways in which we are using it is in our soups. We call them "ciorbă". One of the most common ones that you should definitely try is **Ciorbă de burtă** - Tripe soup. It is made out of beef tripe and can be a bit of an acquired taste though you don't need to be particularly adventurous. While it is commonly found in traditional restaurants, we do make it at home for special occasions as well - my mom always used to make it for New Years Eve. If it does not appeal to you by any means, or you would rather just avoid beef - try its tamed cousin **ciorbă rădăuțeană** - which is the same thing but made with chicken not tripe. Other similar variations include **ciorbă de perișoare** (made with meatballs - but you would need to ask if it is pork or beef), **ciorba de pui a la grec** (Greek style chicken soup) - is it really Greek? I do not really know.

### Grilled meats

I have to say we are pretty big and proud of our meats - especially pork. One of the main activities in the summer is to go out for a grill - where the staple is just meat.
Must try is **mititei** or **mici** - these are skinless sausages made out of a combination of beef, pork and lamb. Most commonly eaten with mustard and bread. Some people eat them with fries as well. Any other side is not very common. Other common meats include **pork sausages**, especially **caltaboș**. In my family, we have this one particularly around Christmas time.

While a lot of the traditional places in the city will serve some variations of meats - I would recommend going to [Piața 9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3SVWnqhyMiuSBtyy6) (*not* the citadel location).


### Stewed meats - tocanițe

We make a lot of stew-like dishes especially in home-cooking. It is common to see **chicken liver** stew, **paprikas** ( a chicken stew with paprika, hand made noodle and sour cream of course - a cross-over between Hungarian and Romanian cuisine), or any other meats. Usually we have them with a side, most commonly **polenta** or even mashed potatoes.

### Cold meats

Our cold meats game is a bit more brave. As an example we like to use lard as a spread on bread **pâine cu untură** often times topped with onion and salt. We don't like to waste anything from the pig - so we also make **tobă** - which is meat (mainly the face and organs, including ears) that has been pressed together and then sliced like very thick deli meat. It is commonly found as an appetizer, especially for celebrations like Christmas. We also like our collagen - so we make **piftie** which is boiled pork with seasonings and cooled down into a savory meat jello dish. It is actually pretty good and commonly served around Christmas (when your mom and grandma store it on the balcony as it is colder than the fridge *true story*).
Also, forget the cheese platter and jabon. Take a piece of **slănină** (cured pig fat), some **brânză de burduf** (traditional cheese that has been stored in the stomach of a sheep), **jumări** / **jumeri**(Romanian pork rinds) and eat it with some bread, pickles and onion.

> One tweak on the **slănină** - we like to melt it over fire and drip it onto bread - Cheers!

### Other appetizers and salads

While we take a lot of pride in our pork dishes, we also need to watch our cholesterol at times. As an appetizer we sometimes have **zacuscă**. My favorite one is the fire roasted eggplant one, but we have mushroom and bean variations as well. This is a roasted pepper based spread on bread. It is similar to Ajvar. We also love our **Eggplant** salad - which is similar to Baba Ganoush but uses mayo instead of tahini.
We also love fish eggs! So we like to eat fish egg salad on bread as a spread. This is not the fancy caviar - it is most likely made from carp or trout and it is very similar to the Greek Taramasalata.
While not a spread - **Boef Salad** is also super common and loved by everyone. The catch? I never had it with beef, only with chicken. It is a combination of boiled vegetables, meat, pickled cucumbers and mayo. Variations include peas (as my mom does it) or egg (more Russian style).

### The Desserts

In a casual traditional restaurant, the must-get dessert is **papanași**. These are fried cheese balls, typically served with sour cream and blueberry jam (no other jam).
We also have the boiled version, which is served with cinnamon, sugar and breadcrumbs.
A more homey dessert is the **gomboți cu prune** (plum dumplings) - potato dumplings stuffed with plums and covered in sugar, breadcrumbs and cinnamon.
You will also see crepes in the dessert options - given the option you could try the ones with farmer's cheese and/or jam.

For more **confectionary desserts**, try **amandina** - our decadent version of a brownie, **savarină** - a sponge cake with syrup, strawberry jam and whipping cream (somewhere between a baba au rhum and a victoria sponge cake), **doboș** (multi-layered chocolate walnut cake) - also at the crossing between Romanian and Hungarian cuisine.

For snacks and desserts that you could find in a bakery, try the **prăjitură cu mere** (sheet apple cake), **prăjitură cu brânză**, **linzer cu mac** (a type of poppyseed cake), **cozonac**/**bagli** (a rolled sweet bread traditionally filled with walnut or poppyseeds), **cornulețe** (little rolled cookies filled with jam, **magiun** - *plum honey*, or walnut).

## Restaurant Highlights

If you are looking for restaurants with a traditional fair, I would suggest the following
- Hanul cu noroc
- Desaga
- Hanul Pescariful ( fish focused)
- Piata 9 ( to some extend)

If you would like something nicer but not strictly traditional
- Allegria
- Rivo

## Getting around in the city

### By foot

The city is very walklable - most if the city center can be seen on foot.

### By tram/bus

As an experience, you could try taking the tram or bus. We rely on them all the time, equally much. See the [official website](https://www.otlra.ro/index.php/en/tickets-and-season-tickets) for more details.

### By taxi

Taxi stations are everywhere. They are reliable - just make sure they start the meter especially since you are a foreigner. You will be surprised though how many of them actually speak English.

For taxi, I recommend downloading the [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en/) app. It is super reliable and works better then Uber in the city. Alternatively, Uber exists as well but might not be as good here.

## Gotchas, cultural things and getting around

- With foreigners, people will most likely be welcoming - but don't expect American level of excitement.
- People smoke - a lot, but mostly outdoors.
- Don't rely on it, but around the city there are spots of free wifi that actually kind of work.
- Tipping is optional, but like a 5 - 10% tip is nice of you.
- As a traveler in a new city, I am usually scared of tourist traps in restaurants (big menus, pizza and burgers alongside traditional food, cafes in the center). Here this is not the case - having an extensive menu is common, and it actually targets locals that wouldn't eat traditional food when going out. Cafes in the center - common and lovely.
- We have bakeries everywhere - don't try too hard to look for the best one - trust your eyes more than anything.
- Things are slow and closed on Sunday - religion is a pretty big thing.
- We have a big mall if you need to do some shopping - [Lotus Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XhNKUVYdhUdshYSq7) - but I personally wouldn't go out of my way to go there unless you need something.
- Grocery stores are everywhere. The best chains are **Profi** and **Carrefour** (there are other bigger ones but probably beyond the scope of your visit).
